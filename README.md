# gold_price_prediction
This project focuses on predicting the price of gold using historical data and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various columns, including Date, S&P 500 index (SPX), Gold price (GLD), United States Oil Fund (USO), Silver price (SLV), and Euro to US Dollar exchange rate (EUR/USD).

Project Overview:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The initial phase involved conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Key steps included:

Comparing correlations among different fields using a heatmap to identify potential relationships.
Examining the distribution of gold prices and determining the central tendencies to understand the data's overall behavior.
Model Building:
The primary objective was to create a predictive model for gold prices. For this purpose, the project employed the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The steps involved in building the model were:

Data preparation and preprocessing.
Training the Random Forest Regressor using the processed data.
Evaluating the model's accuracy and performance.
The results of this project provide valuable insights into gold price trends and offer a functional model for predicting future gold prices based on historical data.
